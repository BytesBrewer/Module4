    <string name="nsg_mission">The National Security Guard (NSG) is an Indian special forces unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). It was raised in 1984, following Operation Blue Star and the assassination of Indira Gandhi (for combating terrorist activities with a view to protect states against internal disturbances).
        \n\nNSG is under the authority of Ministry of Home Affairs. However it is not categorised under the uniform nomenclature of Central Armed Police Forces. It has a special forces mandate, and its core operational capability is provided by the Special Action Group (SAG) which is drawn from the Indian Army. The Special Rangers Group (SRG), the police component of NSG, which also handles VIP security, is composed of personnel on deputation from other Central Armed Police Forces and State Police Forces.
\n\nThe NSG personnel are often referred to in the media as Black Cats because of the black outfit and black cat insignia worn on their uniform.
\n\nThe National Security Guard (NSG) was set up in 1984 as a Federal Contingency Deployment Force to tackle all facets of terrorism in the country. As a specialized counter terrorism force, it is intended for use (only in exceptional situations) and not meant to take over the (functions of the State Police Forces or other Para Military Forces). Yet, over the years its role has vastly expanded to provide personal security to influential politicians quite independent of the real threat that they face.
\n\nThe NSG is trained to conduct counter terrorist task to including counter hijacking tasks on land, sea, and air; Bomb disposal (search, detection and neutralization of IEDs); PBI (Post Blast Investigation) and Hostage Rescue missions.
